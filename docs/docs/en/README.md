## Introduction

Currently, there are numerous AI aggregation proxy sites available. Each time you need to check balances, model lists, and API keys, you have to log in to each one individually, which is very cumbersome.

This extension can automatically identify and integrate the management of AI aggregation proxy accounts based on the following projects:

- [one-api](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api)
- [new-api](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api)
- [Veloera](https://github.com/Veloera/Veloera)
- [one-hub](https://github.com/MartialBE/one-hub)
- [done-hub](https://github.com/deanxv/done-hub)
- VoAPI (closed source, older versions supported)
- Super-API (closed source)
- RIX_API (closed source, basic functionality supported)
