# FAQ

A collection of frequently asked questions encountered while using the extension.

## 🔐 Authentication

### What’s the difference between Cookie mode and Access Token mode?

The extension supports two authentication modes:

| Mode | Highlights | When to Use | Recommendation |
|------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Access Token** | ✅ Supports multiple accounts<br>✅ Never expires<br>✅ More secure and stable | Most standard relay sites | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Highly recommended |
| **Cookie** | ⚠️ Single account only<br>⚠️ May expire<br>✅ Better compatibility | Sites that disable tokens<br>Heavily customized deployments | ⭐⭐⭐ Use for special cases |

**Recommended:** Use the Access Token mode whenever possible, unless:
- The site does not expose access tokens
- You are using a heavily customized relay site
- Token functionality is disabled by the site owner

### How do I switch the authentication mode?

When adding an account, choose the desired mode directly in the dialog:
1. Click **“Add account”**
2. Enter the site URL
3. Choose `Access Token` or `Cookie` in **Authentication**
4. Click **“Auto-detect”**

## 🔧 Site-specific Issues

### AnyRouter keeps failing—what should I do?

AnyRouter is a heavily customized relay site and does not support the standard Access Token workflow.

**Solution:**
1. Select **Cookie mode** when adding the account
2. Log in to AnyRouter in your browser first
3. Use the auto-detect flow afterward

::: warning Heads-up
Because AnyRouter has modified its API, some features may still not work. If issues remain, please contact the site administrator.
:::

### Auto-detection fails—how can I fix it?

Try the following steps:

1. **Switch authentication mode:** Try Cookie mode if Access Token fails
2. **Add manually:** Fill in the username, user ID, access token, and exchange rate manually
3. **Check login state:** Ensure you have logged in to the site in this browser
4. **Verify compatibility:** Confirm the site is based on a supported project (see below)

### Which sites might be incompatible?

Sites that radically change core APIs (such as `/api/user`) may not work properly.

Common incompatibilities include:
- Custom user information endpoints
- Access tokens disabled
- Non-standard authentication flows
- Different response formats compared to upstream projects

## 🔒 Data Safety

### Where is my data stored?

- **Local storage:** Everything is stored locally in your browser

   - Save the JSON file securely

2. **WebDAV sync (recommended):**

## 🆘 Other Questions

### What is duplicate site detection?

When adding a site, the extension checks if the same base URL already exists:
- Detects duplicate URLs
- Prompts you to update the existing entry instead
- Keeps your list clean and tidy

### What do the health statuses mean?

Each account shows a health badge:

| Status | Icon | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| 🟢 Healthy | Healthy | Everything works normally |
| 🟡 Warning | Warning | Needs attention (e.g., low balance) |
| 🔴 Error | Error | API call failed or account unusable |
| ⚪ Unknown | Unknown | Not yet checked or unavailable |

### Does the extension consume much traffic?

- Only calls the site APIs during refresh
- Each refresh is lightweight (a few KB per site)
- We recommend auto-refreshing on Wi-Fi connections
